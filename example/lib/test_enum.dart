/// Example of how to use [EnumClass].
///
/// Enum constants must be declared as `static const`. Initialize them from
/// the generated code. You can use any initializer starting _$ and the
/// generated code will match it. For example, you could initialize "yes" to
/// "_$yes", "_$y" or even "_$abc".
///
/// You need to write three pieces of boilerplate to hook up the generated
/// code: a constructor called `_`, a `values` method, and a `valueOf` method.

/// Optionally, enum_class can generate a mixin to go with your enum for use
/// with Angular. It exposes your enum constants as getters. So, if you mix it
/// in to your Dart component class, the values become available to the
/// corresponding Angular template.
///
/// Trigger mixin generation by writing a line like this one next to your enum.
abstract class TestEnumMixin = Object with _$TestEnumMixin;

/// It's possible to have multiple enums in the same file.
///
/// For this to work, you need to change any generated names that clash. For
/// example, _$values and _$valueOf will always clash. You can change them
/// to anything you like, the code generation wll match what you write.
